# Slower Armor Progression

Concept originally suggested by [u/ThirdWorlfBoy21 on r/minecraftsuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/10ntllr/making_leather_armor_useful/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf); Datapack created by Havio

## Backstory

The concept of this datapack originates from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/10ntllr/making_leather_armor_useful/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on Reddit. The purpose of it was to expand the gameplay loop for crafting armor and grant leather armor an additional use. I quite liked the idea so I asked the original poster for permission to create and upload their idea in the form of a datapack and was granted such.

# What's Included?

Once this datapack is installed crafting any tier of armor(except Netherite) requires the corresponding leather armor piece. This is showcased in the following gif:

## Additional Information

Any corresponding leather armor piece can be used, even if it's enchanted, dyed or otherwise altered.
